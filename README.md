# Quiz Generator


## Project Description

Load in your quiz questions and be prompted to solve them

Also my first honest experiment with test-driven development


## TODO's


### Meta

- Create an outline of steps to get things running


### Improvements

#### High Priority

- Return to a menu or show statistics when problem set has been completed instead of exiting

- Hide sample topics

#### Medium Priority

- Provide more distinctive visual boundaries between problems

- Handle case of empty topic directory instead of infinite and empty selection loop


### Features

#### High Priority

- Replace incorrect answers so they're asked again
- Allow retrying problem immediately after getting it incorrect

- Allow user to save quiz results and extended statistics (results history) to file

- Save and display stats (previous/current quiz, any quiz in the past)

- Allow skipping a problem without being marked incorrect
- Allow marking answer as uncertain/guess so it'll be asked again even if correct

#### Medium Priority

- Allow use of a countdown timer

- Ask a problem an additional number of times if it was missed on previous quizzes
- Create new quizzes composed of missed problems from previous quizzes

- Create a GUI

#### Low Priority

- Allow premature return to menu and/or clean exit
- Allow pausing quizzes and exiting

- Allow CLI arguments (eg, specify a topic directory)
